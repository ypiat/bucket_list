For this project I created json-server.
You can clone it here https://github.com/ypiat/bucket_list_server/tree/main, then open in terminal and write the command json-server --watch db.json to start the server.

I also used FireBase storage. So you need to create one https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ and put your own data in src/environments/environment.ts.
